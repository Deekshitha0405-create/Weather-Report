# Weather-Report
The Weather Report App is a  interactive web application built using React.js that displays real-time weather information for a selected location. It fetches data from a public weather API (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) and presents the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecast.
